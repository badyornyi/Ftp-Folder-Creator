# Ftp-Folder-Creator
Folders Tree creation via FTP. Can be used in Jmeter (just make .jar file)

I've created this when I needed to upload files to FTP using Jmeter.
But also my test had to create some subfolders structure before uploading.
So you may take this code, change it a bit, make JAR file and use it in Jmeter or wherever you like.

Most part of this code isn't mine, It was found in the Inet (I don't remember where exacly) and then was changed a bit.
So if you'll find a piece of your code here - pm me, I'll add you as co-author


DEPENDENCIES: I've used file "commons-net-3.3.jar" to add some FTP features to my code. You'll have to add it into your project.
